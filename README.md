# Intro

2D Particle Simulator:
A simple program that initializes random initial positions and velocities for point particles and shows their movement.

Change variables in Initial_params.txt to control simulation parameters

Python modules used :-
1) NumPy
2) Flask


# Objectives

- Using math to demonstrate physical phenomenon in a computer simulation.
- Javascript and python integration using Flask.
- Hands-on with WebGL.


# Future Development Plans
(Stuff that is possible but I don't have the time to implement)

- Current code is rather inefficient and it is possible to optimize further.
- Custom initial parameters using a csv file.
- Continuous data creation and simulation (if code is fast enough).
- Dynamic user input and simulation parameter updates (see last point).
