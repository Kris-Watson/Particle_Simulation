[Info]
# This simulation generates random particles with random velocities.
# Currently custom values don't exist.
# You may change Particle_Simulation.py for your needs.

# Number		Number of particles generated by random generator
# Velocity		Multiply all velocities by this value
# Radius		Hitbox for collisions (Currently doesn't update visually in webgl)
# Size		Worldsize - larger world means more space for particles to move (Does not change size of canvas in webgl)
# Duration		Duration of simulation in ms


[Additional Info]
# Number of particles will exponentially affect computational cost
# If particles "clump up", try reducing radius or number of particles
# Particles may move beyond boundary if velocity multiplier is too high.
